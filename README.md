# Fitner

During the COVID-19 pandemic, time spent at home, time spent not exercising, and time spent alone has been at an all time high. This is why, we decided to introduce FITNER to the other fitness nerds like ourselves who struggle to find others to participate in exercise with. As we all know that it is easier to stay healthy, and happy with friends.

We created Fitner as a way to help you find friends to go hiking with, play tennis or even go bowling with! It can be difficult to practice the sport that you love when none of your existing friends are interested, and you do not have the time commitment to join a club. Fitner solves this issue by bridging the gap between fitness nerds who want to reach their potential but don't have the community to do so.

Fitner will be a fitness community build with React Native for an iOS and Android front-end, and Google Cloud / Firebase as the backend. We were inspired by the opportunity to use Google Cloud platforms in our application, so we decided to do something we had never done before, which was real-time communication. Although it was our first time working with real-time communication, we found ourselves, in real-time, overtaking the challenges that came along with it. We are very proud of our work ethic, our resulting application and dedication to our first ever hackathon. 

Future implementations of our application can include public chat rooms that users may join and plan public sporting events with, and a more sophisticated algorithm which would suggest members of the community that are at a similar skill and fitness goals as you. With FITNER, your fitness goals will be met easily and smoothly and you will meet lifelong friends on the way!
